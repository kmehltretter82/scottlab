ScottLab version 1 follows the distinguished-token presentation in Dana S.
Scott's [“Domains for Denotational Semantics”](references.md#primary-source).
The implementation uses finite token sets, but it preserves the distinction
between an information system and the domain of states generated from it.

## Beginner vocabulary

The interface must keep these two levels distinct:

- A **token** is one finite observation.
- A **state** is a whole collection of tokens that is consistent and closed
  under entailment.

Two symbols are similarly related but not interchangeable:

- `Δ` is the distinguished, always-present token.
- `⊥` is the least state, with no specific information.

Tokens belong to states. In particular, `Δ` belongs to `⊥`; `Δ` is not another
name for `⊥`.

## Information systems

A version 1 information system is a tuple

```text
A = (T, Δ, Con, ⊢)
```

where:

- `T` is a finite set of tokens;
- `Δ ∈ T` is the distinguished least-informative token;
- `Con` is a collection of finite consistent subsets of `T`; and
- `⊢` relates a consistent finite token set to a token.

Write `X ⊢ Y` when `X ⊢ b` for every token `b ∈ Y`.

For all finite token sets `X` and `Y`, and every token `a`, the following laws
must hold whenever the displayed entailments are defined:

1. **Downward consistency:** if `X ⊆ Y` and `Y ∈ Con`, then `X ∈ Con`.
2. **Singleton consistency:** `{a} ∈ Con`.
3. **Entailment preserves consistency:** if `X ∈ Con` and `X ⊢ a`, then
   `X ∪ {a} ∈ Con`.
4. **Distinguished token:** if `X ∈ Con`, then `X ⊢ Δ`.
5. **Reflexivity:** if `a ∈ X ∈ Con`, then `X ⊢ a`.
6. **Cut:** if `Y ⊢ X` and `X ⊢ a`, then `Y ⊢ a`.

These laws imply weakening: if `X ⊆ Y ∈ Con` and `X ⊢ a`, then `Y ⊢ a`.

## Closure, states, and bottom

For a consistent set of observations `S`, its entailment closure is

```text
closure(S) = { a ∈ T | some finite X ⊆ S entails a }.
```

Because version 1 systems are finite, a consistent finite `S` has the simpler
equivalent description

```text
closure(S) = { a ∈ T | S ⊢ a }.
```

The public `closure` operation must reject an inconsistent input with a
concrete witness rather than returning a state-like result.

A **state** is a token set `x ⊆ T` such that:

1. every finite subset of `x` is consistent; and
2. whenever a finite `X ⊆ x` entails `a`, then `a ∈ x`.

For a finite version 1 system, this is equivalent to

```text
x ∈ Con and closure(x) = x.
```

States are ordered by inclusion. If `x ⊆ y`, then `y` contains at least as much
information as `x`.

Every valid system generates a least state:

```text
⊥ = closure({Δ}) = closure(∅).
```

Thus `⊥` is contained in every state. It contains `Δ` and any other token that
is entailed unconditionally. “No specific information” is the canonical
beginner description; bottom need not be the empty set.

For finite systems, `coverRelation` contains an edge `x → y` exactly when
`x ⊂ y` and no state lies strictly between them. This is the relation displayed
in a Hasse diagram.

## Persisted finite representation

The draft [version 1 JSON Schema](../schemas/information-system.v1.schema.json)
uses a compact presentation rather than listing the full `Con` and `⊢`
relations.

### Consistency

The persisted `minimalInconsistentSets` are the minimal forbidden token
combinations. A finite set `X` is consistent exactly when it contains none of
those combinations as a subset.

The semantic validator must check that:

- every listed token exists;
- every forbidden combination has at least two tokens;
- no forbidden combination contains `delta`; and
- the list is minimal: no listed combination contains another one.

This representation makes downward consistency and singleton consistency
structural, while retaining a concrete witness for every inconsistency.

### Entailment

Each persisted entailment rule has finite premises and one conclusion. The
core constructs the least entailment relation containing those rules and the
required distinguished-token and reflexivity laws, then closes it under cut
and weakening.

The semantic validator must check that:

- every premise and conclusion token exists;
- every premise set is consistent; and
- every derived entailment preserves consistency.

Empty-premise rules are allowed. Their conclusions belong to bottom because
they hold before any specific observation is added.

### Structural and semantic validation

JSON Schema checks document shape. It cannot express token-ID references,
minimality, or the information-system laws, so successful schema validation is
necessary but not sufficient. Imported data must pass the semantic validator
before it changes the active session.

Before evaluating the laws, the semantic validator must check that:

- token IDs are unique;
- rule IDs are unique;
- `delta` names exactly one declared token; and
- every token reference resolves to a declared token.

Exports are deterministic:

- tokens and token IDs inside sets are ordered lexicographically by ID;
- inconsistent sets are ordered lexicographically by their token-ID lists;
- entailment rules are ordered by rule ID; and
- absent optional values are omitted rather than serialized as `null`.

## Flat Booleans

The first preview uses the exact finite system in the
[flat-Boolean fixture](../packages/examples/flat-boolean.system.json).

Its tokens are:

| ID | Presentation | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `delta` | Always-present token (`Δ`) | No specific Boolean information |
| `true` | `true` | The Boolean is true |
| `false` | `false` | The Boolean is false |

The only minimal inconsistent set is

```text
{true, false}.
```

There are no user-declared entailment rules. Entailment is the minimal relation
required by the axioms:

```text
X ⊢ a exactly when a = Δ or a ∈ X.
```

The expected closure results are:

| Input observations | Closure | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `∅` | `{Δ}` | Bottom |
| `{Δ}` | `{Δ}` | Bottom |
| `{true}` | `{Δ, true}` | Valid state |
| `{false}` | `{Δ, false}` | Valid state |
| `{true, false}` | Not computed | Inconsistent witness `{true, false}` |

Exactly three states are generated:

```text
{Δ}          = ⊥
{Δ, true}
{Δ, false}
```

Their cover relation is

```text
{Δ} → {Δ, true}
{Δ} → {Δ, false}.
```

The interface may label the whole state `{Δ}` as `⊥`, but it must let learners
inspect the contained `Δ` token and must never present `Δ` and `⊥` as the same
object.

## Approximable mappings

The version 1
[mapping schema](../schemas/approximable-mapping.v1.schema.json) persists a
finite set of positive generator rules from a source system `A` to a target
system `B`. A rule

```text
P ⇒ b
```

states that the finite source observation `P` justifies the target token `b`.
For a source state `x`, those generators determine the function

```text
F(x) = closure_B({b | some declared P ⇒ b has P ⊆ x}).
```

Target `Δ` therefore appears through target closure; a redundant mapping rule
for it is not required. Empty-premise generators are allowed and contribute a
target observation already at source bottom.

The semantic validator must check that:

- the persisted source and target IDs name the systems supplied for
  validation;
- mapping rule IDs are unique;
- every premise is a known source token and every conclusion is a known target
  token;
- every premise set is consistent in the source system; and
- every collection of rules that can be activated by one consistent source
  observation has jointly consistent target conclusions.

The last condition is checked exhaustively only within an explicit validation
budget. Since target-system validation already proves that entailment preserves
consistency, closing a jointly consistent set of generated conclusions remains
consistent.

These generators are monotone in the information order: if `x ⊆ y`, every
finite premise available in `x` remains available in `y`. Target closure is
also monotone, so `F(x) ⊆ F(y)`. More generally, a finite premise contained in
a directed union is contained in one member of that directed family; this is
the finite-support reason the generated function is Scott continuous. On the
finite state domains currently executed by ScottLab, monotonicity also implies
Scott continuity directly.

### Boolean negation

The exact
[Boolean-negation fixture](../packages/examples/boolean-negation.mapping.json)
has two nonredundant generators:

```text
{false} ⇒ true
{true}  ⇒ false
```

It acts on the three formal Boolean states as follows:

| Source state | Target state |
| --- | --- |
| `{Δ}` | `{Δ}` |
| `{Δ, false}` | `{Δ, true}` |
| `{Δ, true}` | `{Δ, false}` |

This is monotone, not order-reversing. The informative Boolean states are
incomparable: neither `{Δ, false}` nor `{Δ, true}` contains the other. The
only nontrivial source comparisons begin at bottom, and negation preserves
both of them.

Mapping traces are deterministic. They identify the target distinguished
token, every activated mapping generator, and any subsequent target
entailment. When multiple generators support the same target token, the
activation list retains all supports even if a canonical derivation step has
already added the token.

## Deferred conventions

The first preview does not yet persist fixed-point traces, infinite-system
presentations, or general lesson sessions. Those additions must preserve this
document's token/state distinction and use new schema versions when
compatibility would otherwise be ambiguous.
